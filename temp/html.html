<ol>
    <li><strong>Create a new site</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A fresh virtual server was created to host the site, using Ubuntu 18.04LTS for the OS, NodeJs to handle
                the server and website logic/compilation, and NginX to manage the network interfaces.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Length</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The site meets requirement</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Responsive layout, custom theme</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>For the styling and layout, I leveraged a somewhat personally-configured Bootstrap v4, utilizing their
                development package which containes uncompiled SASS rather than CSS, and incorporating it within my
                custom styles. An example is shown below:
                <img
                    src="/public/images/code-1.png"
                    alt="code-1"
                ></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Create an image slider</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The home page features an image slider</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Images use</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Images were used, and alt attributes were included.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Site Navigation</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigation is customized header menu, with a slide-out side navigation list and nested menus for mobile.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Minimum 5 External Links</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Site features an external resources page that serves as a directory of external links.
                http://linksduluth.com/resources</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Title, keywords, other meta tags</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Pages are labeled appropriately as a by-product of server-side rendering.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Landing Page</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>http://linksduluth.com/contact</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Social Media</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Towards the bottom of http://linksduluth.com/</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>A benefit of writing javascript files that control how your server receives, handles and replies to HTTP requests is
    the enhanced control and ability to fine-tune responses. Reading through the <code>app.js</code> file (the main
    entry point and route handler) provides some examples:
    <img
        src="/images/code-2.png"
        alt="code-2"
    >
    Here, detailed logging has been set up, as well as some path sanitization and verification. There's certianly much
    more that can be done in the future.</p>
<h2 id="seo">SEO</h2>
<p>In order to make this site as Search-Engine-Friendly as I could while still keeping maintenance and time invested at
    a reasonable level, I followed basic industry-standard best practices in regards to page <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
    and <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> elements.
    Additionally, page structures are similarly aligned to best-practice and semantic HTML standards.
    This domain is also registered with Google Search Console, and supplies a robots.txt and sitemap.xml file to
    crawlers.</p>
<h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>
<p>Google Analytics scripts are set up on all pages (even this one, hi!) and the GoogleUA key is properly registered.
</p>
<h2 id="ecommerce">Ecommerce</h2>
<p>My e-commerce site was set up under https://links-duluth.myshopify.com - though this was before I realized that the
    site inventory would have no relation to the name. Regardless, it can be reached by following the above link and
    supplying the password:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>brunew</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The site sells artisan soaps and candles from different geographical regions.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>The site meets all minimum accessibility standards. I would have like to have used more intelligent tools to evaluate
    contrasts of the type overlaid on images.</p>
